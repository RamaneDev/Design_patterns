This structural code demonstrates the Flyweight pattern in which a relatively small 
number of objects is shared many times by different clients.

exemple :
In this example, when the client adds the symbol 'A' twice,
only one flyweight object is created by the CharacterFactory.
This demonstrates how the Flyweight pattern can be used to optimize memory usage by reusing 
common objects.
