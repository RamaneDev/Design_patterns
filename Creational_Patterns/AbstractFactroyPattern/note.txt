- provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent 
  objects without specifying concrete classes

- Objects can be grouped into a hierarchy that encapsulates distinct platforms
  consisting of a suite of related objects

- calling code works with abstract interfaces and classes 
  and does not need to know the exact types of the objects created
  by the factory
